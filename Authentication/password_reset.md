## Password Rewrite in Linux

Pre Reqs:
- Already logged in with root access, or with sudo
- Assuming no Disk-Cryptography is involved

When you are logged in, and e.g has a `root` terminal up n running.
You do not know the current password, but want to change it.
Then; 

as root:

```sh
root: cat /etc/shadow
```

let's say our user is 'john':
```
(..):*:(...):0:....:7:::
(..):*:(...):0:....:7:::
(..):*:(...):0:....:7:::
john:*:$y$:(...):0:....:7:::
(..):*:(...):0:....:7:::
(..):*:(...):0:....:7:::
```

You want to replace this `:(...):` with the new hash. 
The new hash can be generated by (as a normal user or root) `openssl passwd -6 abc` which would output something like
- `$6$iHV9GX3eQsU.uUFq$V4PoNgxBRCy/tCf8odAlUrRF2CQppvnTrCHrYmbcTBwCdpx9uZawUAWBNfUT77XpwbanFwkomunJEIJg.Vc350`
1. take the string and
2. cut it
3. paste it (replacing) the `:(...):`  in the `/etc/shadow` file. 


so from

```
john:*:$y$:(............):0:....:7:::
```


to (something broadly speaking like this)
```
john:*:$y$:$6$iHV9GX3eQsU.uUFq$V4PoNgxBRCy/tCf8odAlUrRF2CQppvnTrCHrYmbcTBwCdpx9uZawUAWBNfUT77XpwbanFwkomunJEIJg.Vc350:0:....:7:::
```

then save it. 
Done.

Now you can login using the following credentials:

| **username** | **password** |   
|--------------|--------------|
| john         | abc          |
